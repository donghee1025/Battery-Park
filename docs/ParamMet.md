      Capacity basically represents the amount of electric charge stored in a cell and is one of the key parameters in Li-ion batteries. Hence, measuring its decay over the cell life is important. For charge, CC-CV (constant current – constant voltage) profile is used – constant current used until a voltage limit is reached and constant voltage is applied until current becomes negligible. For discharge, constant current (galvanostatic) is most common due to its easy interpretability and repeatability. A range of C-rates at various temperatures needs to be carefully considered for performance evaluation.
