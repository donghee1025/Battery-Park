## Cells

## Electrochemical cell

> A cell is the smallest building unit of the battery. Main constituents are cathode and anode that are immersed in electrolyte and undergo reduction/oxidation. Cations migrate inside the electrolyte while electrons move through the external load to do the work.
> 
> When a cell is discharged, cations and electrons from the negative electrode move towards the positive electrode, where the reduction takes place (while the negative electrode is oxidized). Different from the case of primary batteries, this process can be reversed through charging in secondary rechargeable batteries.
> 
> Cells also include the separator that isolate the positive and negative electrodes to prevent the electron flow and permit only the ion flow and the current collectors - metal foils where the electrodes are attached and that conduct electrical current to the external circuit.


## Primary vs Secondary

- Primary Cell
> It is a galvanic cell that can only be used once before disposal as the electrochemical reaction is irreversible and the cell is unable to be recharged with electricity.
  
- Secondary Cell
> It is a rechargeable cell with electrochemical reaction reversible by applying the reverse current. Discharge involves converting chemical energy to electricity while the reverse happens upon charge.

## Cell Formats
- Cells can be constructed in many different form factors. These include button/coin-type, cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch-type.


### Coin Cell
*   Coin cells are most commonly used in academic research and for the small consumer electronics parts such as watches and calculators. The electrodes divided by the separator are sealed inside the can with its top and bottom electrically isolated by the gasket. Coin cells have the dimension designation - 20xx, which means 20mm diameter x.x mm height. For example, CR2016 is 20mm in diameter and 1.6 mm in height.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
