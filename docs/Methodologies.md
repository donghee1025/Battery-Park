# Methodologies

## Non-invasive tests

> The following “in-cell” non-invasive tests are designed to track the cell performance changes over cell lifetime by measuring its dynamic and thermodynamic properties. They are done prior to actual disassembly of cells.

----------------------------------------------------

### Capacity Test:

  <div class="column">
    Capacity basically represents the amount of electric charge stored in a cell and is one of the key parameters in Li-ion batteries. Hence, measuring its decay over the cell life is important. For charge, CC-CV (constant current – constant voltage) profile is used – constant current used until a voltage limit is reached and constant voltage is applied until current becomes negligible. For discharge, constant current (galvanostatic) is most common due to its easy interpretability and repeatability. A range of C-rates at various temperatures needs to be carefully considered for performance evaluation.

### Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT):

  </div>
  <div class="column">
    Discharge/charge is done in steps at designated pulse current and lengths, each followed by prolonged relaxation periods for systematic adjustment for cell’s SoC as electrolyte concentration gradient changes along with solid phase redistribution. Much accurate OCV can be obtained by clearing out the kinetic contribution in a cell’s behavior. The technique is employed to measure Li ion diffusion coefficient and structurally driven (e.g. phase transformation, stress) OCV hysteresis and understand ageing behavior.

### Pseudo-OCV:

  </div>
  <div class="column">
    Discharge/charge is performed at very low constant current rate to avoid electrode polarization and ohmic loss despite that there still is hysteresis. “Pseudo-OCV” can be measured by taking an average of the charge and discharge profiles.

### EVS test (Electrochemistry voltage spectroscopy):

<div class="columns">
  <div class="column">

  </div>
  <div class="column">
    The technique is used to determine the degradation mechanism of the cell. It can either be done using incremental capacity (IC) method dQ/dV or differential voltage (DV) analysis dV/dQ, whichever reflects the degradation in the cell better for its origins and mechanisms. IC curve reveals the phase transformations as the peaks shown are associated with voltage plateaus while the DV curve better presents the single-phase regions.
