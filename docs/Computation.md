# Computational Modeling

> Computational modeling plays a crucial role in materials research and design. Various computational modeling methods have been employed to uncover battery reaction mechanisms and derive intrinsic material parameters, which are then used to predict battery performance at the system level based on complex electrochemical transport equations.
> Depending on the modeling approaches and scale, multiscale simulations, such as first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, phase field modeling, continuum simulations, and (electro-)thermal modeling, have been actively adopted to design batteries from the cell to the pack level.

## First-Principles Calculations:

- First-principles calculations involve atomic-level simulations used to predict the properties of previously unknown materials by solving the many-body time-indepedent Schr√∂dinger equation through various numerical approximations, such as the Hartree-Fock (HF) method, Density Functional Theory (DFT), and hybrid approaches. These calculations provide inherent material properties, including atomic coordinates and electronic structure properties, without requiring any input from experiments, thereby aiding in the interpretation of experimental observations.
This computational approach offers key properties of lithium-ion batteries, such as the calculation of equilibrium voltages and voltage profiles, theoretical capacity, ionic mobilities, structural stability and corresponding volume changes, as well as thermal and electrochemical stabilities. This understanding provides significant insights into the intrinsic properties of batteries and aids in optimizing battery materials.

- Calculated electronic density of states and band structures of Sb, Li2Sb and Li3Sb using HSE functional.
The electrodes of an electrochemical cell should exhibit some degree of electronic conductivity to ensure that electrons can reach the electrode/electrolyte interface, where the electrochemical reactions occur. The electronic properties of each important intermediate phases can provide a better understanding of the reaction mechanism at the interface during the reaction. This insight can help identify the rate-determining steps and the origins of overpotential.
